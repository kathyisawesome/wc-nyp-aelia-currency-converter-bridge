## How to Use As A Template for Establishing Compatibility with Other Multicurrency Plugins

Refer to the `convert_price()` method. It's a wrapper function for converting a price from one currency to the other. Specifically you'll need to modify this function [here](https://github.com/helgatheviking/wc-nyp-aelia-currency-converter-bridge/blob/master/wc-name-your-price-aelia.php#L130) to use your Multicurrency plugin's own conversion logic. The bridge plugin _should_ help take care of suggested, minimum, maximum, and cart prices, but it will all depend on how exactly your multicurrency plugin behaves.
